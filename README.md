# BouncingBall2
The final rendition of the BouncingBall project

This is a website to host a p5 project that I just recently learned, mostly from Prof Xianong Meng. My p5js editor for this repository: https://editor.p5js.org/gar018/sketches/FB9Ant76e

Note the program actually generates a video the balls bounce back and forth inside a pre-defined screen frame.
This program was derived from a template made by Evan Peck and provided by Prof Xianong Meng. There are three changes I have made to its features:
1. The 'Hello World!' text is now centered, with its collision box moved accordingly
2. Balls can no longer get stuck, and will be moved when trapped in a collision area
3. The color of the text box changes according to the color of the last ball that collided with it.

The website that runs the program is at https://gar018.github.io/BouncingBall2/
